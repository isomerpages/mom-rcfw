COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need to address growing inequalities in the world of work. This includes the differing abilities of businesses and workers in the region to adopt a hybrid work model, differing levels of access to training and skills upgrading, as well as challenges faced in developing an inclusive workplace culture that supports mental well-being and work-life harmony. This conference will bring together senior government, union and employer representatives, to share lessons learnt from COVID-19 on promoting inclusivity in the future world of work. In view of the International Labour Organizationâ€™s global call to orient a human-centred recovery that is inclusive, sustainable and resilient, the speakers will also discuss the pertinent challenges and opportunities for regional tripartite partners to (i) promote inclusive models for hybrid work, (ii) make lifelong learning work for all and (iii) support mental well-being and work-life harmony.
