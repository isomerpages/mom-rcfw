#### The RCFW's ASEAN Future of Work Conference is back for it's second run! We will once again be a part of the popular online HR Tech Festival Asia organised by HRM Asia. 

This conference will bring together senior government, union and employer representatives, to share lessons learnt from COVID-19 on promoting inclusivity in the future world of work. In view of the International Labour Organizationâ€™s global call to orient a human-centred recovery that is inclusive, sustainable and resilient, the speakers will also discuss the pertinent challenges and opportunities for regional tripartite partners to (i) promote inclusive models for hybrid work, (ii) make lifelong learning work for all and (iii) support mental well-being and work-life harmony.
