### The RCFW's ASEAN Future of Work Conference is back for it's second run! We will once again be a part of the popular online HR Tech Festival Asia organised by HRM Asia. 

**Join us virtually from 10.00AM to 3.40PM on 23 Sep 2021** to hear senior government, union and employer representatives share about the lessons learnt from COVID-19 on promoting inclusivity in the future world of work. In view of the International Labour Organizationâ€™s global call to orient a human-centred recovery that is inclusive, sustainable and resilient, the speakers will also discuss the pertinent challenges and opportunities for regional tripartite partners to:
1. promote inclusive models for hybrid work, 
2. make lifelong learning work for all and 
3. support mental well-being and work-life harmony. 

There will also be discussions on the shift towards a more human-centric approach to the future of work.
