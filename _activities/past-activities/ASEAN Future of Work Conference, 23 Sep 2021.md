### We held our ASEAN Future of Work Conference as part of the popular HR Tech Festival Asia Online for the second time. 

In view of the International Labour Organizationâ€™s global call to orient a human-centred recovery that is inclusive, sustainable and resilient, senior government, union and employer representatives shared insights on fostering an inclusive future world of work. They also discussed the challenges and opportunities for different stakeholders to:
1. promote inclusive models of hybrid work, 
2. make lifelong learning work for all and 
3. support mental well-being and work-life harmony.
