The Singapore Ministry of Manpower, in collaboration with the National Trade Unions Congress (NTUC) and Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF), co-organised the Singapore Conference on the Future of Work with the International Labour Organization (ILO) on 29 April 2019. The conference was a response to the ILO’s call for each member state to conduct national conversations and set out its response to the ILO Global Commission’s Report on the Future of Work, which was released on 22 January 2019. 

The conference brought together more than 700 government, worker and employer representatives from ASEAN Member States and ASEAN’s six dialogue partners – Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea and New Zealand.
