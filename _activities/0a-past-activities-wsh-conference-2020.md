### Theme: Enabling Business and Empowering Workforce in the COVID-19 World

Amidst much uncertainty and dampened economic activity, businesses worldwide are still battling the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with digitalisation and transformation challenges, the journey to recovery is set to be protracted. To promote safe working conditions for all workers and instil a preventive culture that safeguards workers' safety and health, the RCFW is working with the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) to organise this year's Singapore Workplace Safety and Health e-Conference 2020. 

This will be a good opportunity to discuss perspectives and developments towards the advancement of WSH in our region post-COVID. The e-Conferene will present ideas and rich experiences from renowned speakers on how WSH can help businesses regain their footing and build resilience. Business owners will gain valuable insights into how WSH can effectively transform their business operations. Employees will also benefit from a sustainable culture of care, trust and risk prevention in the workplace.
