Amidst much uncertainty and dampened economic activity, businesses worldwide are still battling the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with digitalisation and transformation challenges, the journey to recovery is set to be protracted. To promote safe working conditions for all workers and instil a preventive culture that safeguards workers' safety and health, the RCFW partnered the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) to organise the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Conference 2020. 

The e-Conferene presented ideas and rich experiences from renowned speakers on how WSH could help businesses regain their footing and build resilience. Business owners also gained valuable insights on how WSH could effectively transform their business operations. 

Over 1,800 participants from Singapore and across the Asia Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia attended the 2-day virtual conference.
