The Singapore Ministry of Manpower is collaborating with HRM Asia on the “ASEAN Future of Work” track at the HR Tech Festival Asia 2020, from 29 September – 1 October 2020. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation, the event will be held virtually this year.

This annual event has typically been attended by over 4,000 participants in recent years. Representatives from the government, worker and employer organisations, industry leaders and HR practitioners who are interested in the future of work are encouraged to attend.

International experts and tripartite partners will share on challenges and best practices to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the labour market, as well as solutions to support business transformation and human capital development in the Future of Work.

- Day 1 will focus on mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on labour markets in the region, the importance of tripartite collaboration and improving employment facilitation services in a post-COVID world.

- Day 2 will focus on transforming the HR sector to help businesses and workers tackle challenges and seize opportunities during the pandemic and beyond.

- Day 3 will focus on the impact of technological advances on industries and developing the necessary digital skills through lifelong learning.
