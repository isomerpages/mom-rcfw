### Have you registered to attend our ASEAN Future of Work Conference? 

The theme of this year's Conference is "**Navigating Labour Market Recovery: A Balancing Act for Businesses, Workers and Governments**".

The Conference will discuss how governments, unions and the private sector can work together to balance stakeholder needs and interests, in adapting to new ways of working and preparing workers for the jobs of the future. 

We have a really exciting lineup of speakers from Singapore, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China, who will join us for four panel discussions on:

1.	The Future of AI in HR: Balancing Innovation, Ethics and Governance
2.	Successful Flexible Work Arrangements: Managing the Trade-offs between Remote and Onsite Work 
3.	Strengthening Labour Protections for Platform Workers: A Delicate Balance Between Protecting Workers and Promoting Enterprise Competitiveness 
4.	Employability or Employment: Supporting Our Youth for the Best Start at Work
