### The RCFW’s focus areas takes into account the common areas of interest for countries in the region and their different levels of development. They are: 

### 1. Embracing Technology for Inclusive Growth 
We need to adapt to technological advances and support 

- employers in leveraging upon technology to transform and redesign jobs; 
- workers to upskill and reskill so that they remain competitive and better prepared to adapt to the jobs of the future.  

By ensuring that every worker and business can fulfil their maximum potential, we can ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth for all. 

### 2. Workplace Safety and Health 
Every worker has the right to safe and decent work. We need to ensure safe working conditions and entrench a preventative HR culture that prioritises workers’ safety and health. This includes advocating for all aspects of workplace safety, from maintaining public health to preventing workplace injuries and property damage. 

Companies with positive safety cultures can also increase employee engagement, morale and productivity. By placing a priority on workplace safety and health, we can progress towards a more caring society. 
   
### 3. Tripartism and Social Dialogue
Tripartite collaboration in designing practical solutions to address emerging challenges is even more critical than before. Governments, employers’ and workers’ organisations must work together to promote greater social dialogue and share best practices to ready our people for the Future of Work. Each stakeholder group can provide different perspectives on the concerns and challenges faced by the individuals that they represent, so that a holistic approach can be adopted to creative solutioning.
