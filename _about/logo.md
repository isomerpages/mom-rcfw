The warm yellow represents friendship and camaraderie between regional tripartite partners, while the orange represents the vibrancy and commitment of ASEAN as a region, to work together to answer the ILO's call to "Work for a Brighter Future" for all people. 

The **sixteen coloured dots** form a circle to symbolise our aspiration for united and harmonious relations between tripartite partners of the ten ASEAN member states and six dialogue partners. These dots are enclosed within a **speech bubble** to represent our objective of promoting social dialogue between these key stakeholders, through our suite of activities.

The **uppercase and lowercase letter ‘I’** represent the RCFW’s focus to nurture innovative ideas and share insights on adapting to Future of Work trends. 

Together, the speech bubble and letter ‘I’s form an **abstract head** which represents our human-centred approach in ensuring that the interest of workers and employers remain at the centre of discussions in preparing the region for the Future of Work.
