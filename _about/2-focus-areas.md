### The RCFW’s focus areas takes into account the common areas of interest for countries in the region and their different levels of development. They are: 

### 1. Tripartism and Social Dialogue 
Close partnerships between government, employers and workers’ organisations will be critical to tackle Future of Work (FoW) challenges. It is important to bring together tripartite partners across the region, to promote greater social dialogue in addressing the FoW. 

### 2. Workplace Safety and Health 
We need to ensure that working conditions remain safe and entrench a preventative culture across employers that prioritises workers’ safety and health. This is one of the key foundational elements of decent work. 
   
### 3. Embracing Technology 
We need to adapt to technological advances and support 
- employers in leveraging upon technology to transform and redesign jobs; 
- workers to upskill and reskill to keep their competencies up to date, and better prepare them for new job opportunities. 

This is important to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth for all individuals.
