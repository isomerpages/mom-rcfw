The Regional Centre for the Future of Work (RCFW) is a new initiative by the Singapore Ministry of Manpower, supported by our tripartite partners, the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF). 

It aims to bring together international experts, key ASEAN tripartite stakeholders and our regional dialogue partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea), to discuss approaches towards preparing workers and employers for the Future of Work. 

With more than 640 million people, ASEAN is collectively the world’s fifth-largest economy. While ASEAN’s economy continues to grow, ASEAN’s progress is at stake if it does not actively address transformative forces brought about by technological innovations and digital disruptions to existing employment modes. Changing population demographics and climate change will also cause further strains and disruptions to both businesses and workers.

The RCFW is a direct response to the International Labour Organization’s (ILO) 2019 Centennial call to all members states to “Work for a Brighter Future”. During the 2019 Singapore Conference on the Future of Work, Minister for Manpower Mrs. Josephine Teo announced Singapore’s intention to set up a regional initiative, for continued social dialogue and capacity building on this pertinent topic. This was supported by the ASEAN member states, as illustrated by the signing of the ASEAN Labour Ministers’ Statement on the Future of Work at the Singapore Conference. The ASEAN leaders recognised that the regional initiative would allow ASEAN member states to put into action the ILO’s and the United Nation’s vision of “promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all”.
