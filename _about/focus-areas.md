### The RCFW’s focus areas takes into account the common areas of interest for countries in the region and their different levels of development. They are:

We need to adapt to technological advances and support 
 
- employers in leveraging upon technology to transform and redesign jobs; 
- workers to upskill and reskill so that they remain competitive and better prepared to adapt to the jobs of the future.  

By ensuring that every worker and business can fulfil their maximum potential, we can foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth for all. The use of technology, e.g. in remote working, has become even more important as countries resume economic activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

Workplace safety and health (WSH) is the foundation for decent work. We need to ensure safe working conditions and entrench a preventative HR culture that prioritises workers’ safety and health. This includes advocating for all aspects of workplace safety, from maintaining public health to preventing workplace injuries and property damage. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new meaning to WSH. It is critical for our region to focus on WSH capabilities, to ensure a safe recovery and provide decent work for all.

<br>
Tripartite collaboration in designing practical solutions to address emerging challenges is even more critical than before, due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has put the spotlight especially on those in precarious work, and it is through tripartism that we can ensure that the dignity and worth of every worker is recognised.

Governments and employers’ and workers’ organisations must work together to promote greater social dialogue and share best practices to tackle Future of Work challenges. Each stakeholder group can provide different perspectives on the concerns and challenges faced by the individuals that they represent, so that a holistic approach can be adopted to develop practical solutions.
