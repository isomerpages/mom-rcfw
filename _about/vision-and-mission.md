The RCFW will institutionalise our regionâ€™s collective effort to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to tackle Future of Work challenges, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To do so, we will bring together international experts, key ASEAN tripartite stakeholders and our regional dialogue partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea), to:

- foster social dialogue;

- share knowledge and

- build capabilities to prepare ASEAN for the Future of Work.
