### To guide the work of the RCFW, we are convening a small group of distinguished representatives and subject-matter experts to take on the role of advisors for the RCFW. We will have a good mix of representatives from international, regional organisations, ASEAN governments, workersâ€™ unions and employers.

The advisors will:

- keep the RCFW updated and current in its focus areas;

- advise on its strategy and activities to build regional capacity in dealing with the Future of Work; as well as

- recommend international thought leaders and speakers whom the region can learn from.
