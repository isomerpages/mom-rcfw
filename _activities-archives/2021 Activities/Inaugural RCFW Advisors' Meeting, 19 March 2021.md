Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower chaired the virtual meeting with the Advisors. The Advisors shared insights on the emerging challenges and opportunities in preparing ASEAN for a post-pandemic Future of Work. They agreed that tripartite collaboration is needed more than ever to address the impact of COVID-19 and emerge stronger as a region.

We thank our Advisors for their valuable input on the key areas of focus and best practices which will guide our Regional Centre’s strategic directions and upcoming capacity building activities for the year.
