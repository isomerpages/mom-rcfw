**Introduction**

1.  Good morning. On behalf of the tripartite partners in Singapore, welcome to the Conference on the Future of Work, especially to all our overseas delegates.
2.  The Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) are honoured to co-organise this conference together with the International Labour Organization (ILO).
3.  The topic today is the Future of Work. All of us have a vested interest in it.
    -   Unionists are concerned about workers’ livelihoods,
    -   Businesses wonder how their workforce must adapt,
    -   Governments want to make sure that growth is inclusive, economies stay vibrant, and societies remain cohesive.
4.  We congratulate the ILO on its centenary and thank DG Guy Ryder for ILO’s leadership in starting important conversations about the future of work.
    -   The Global Commission’s report is aptly titled “Work for a Brighter Future”.
    -   It made clear each country should develop its own set of national strategies, adapted to national circumstances.
    -   But learning from each other is always helpful.
5.  Our conference in Singapore hopes to make a small contribution to this important global conversation

**ASEAN**

6.  The great advantage for ASEAN is that our economies are growing. If this were not so, it will be harder to look to the future with a sense of hope.
    -   With more than 640 million people, ASEAN is today collectively the world’s fifth-largest economy.
    -   ASEAN’s economy has grown by an average of 5.3% annually since 2000, above the global average of 3.8%.
    -   Our GDP has more than quadrupled over the last two decades to about US$2.7 trillion1  today. This is faster than many other emerging economies.
7.  Even with an overall growth story, we are not without challenges.

**Challenges**

8.  First, demographic shifts.
9.  Globally, the total fertility rate (TFR) has been in steady decline for decades.
    -   In the early 50s, half of the world’s population lived in countries where TFR was above 5.5.
    -   From the last decade, more than half of the world’s population already lived in countries with below replacement TFR, which is 2.12,3
    -   Among the 10 ASEAN member states, five have below- replacement TFR. Most people are surprised when I share this factoid.
10.  While TFR decreases, life expectancy has been going up with improved healthcare. This means that the size of aged population will grow rapidly all over the world.
    -   By 2030, the number of people in the world aged 60 and over will be about the same as China’s population today, at about 1.4 billion.
    -   In 2015, Japan was the only country in Asia with an elderly population (aged 65 and over) exceeding 15%, but that is a thing of the past.
    -   Even within ASEAN, the proportion of the population aged 65 and above, is expected to double over two decades, from 7.7% in 2015 to about 15.5% in 2035.
11.  While some countries in ASEAN have rapidly growing youth populations today, with these demographics, the size of the working age population will fall with time.
12.  These developments could mean
    -   Increased pressures on pension or retirement support systems, including for informal workers and, as a result,
    -   And a need to adjust our strategies. In particular, our growth strategies.
13.  Besides demographics, the second challenge is that technology will also change the jobs landscape. We now know:
    -   Technology creates new jobs even as it causes some to be lost
    -   More importantly, all existing jobs are likely to be transformed
    -   However, it is not a given that job quality will improve for everyone.
14.  How can we
    -   take full advantage of technology to improve job quality,
    -   and just as importantly, to walk this journey with our workers?
15.  Finally, we also have to be mindful of climate change, which could further disrupt businesses and workers.
