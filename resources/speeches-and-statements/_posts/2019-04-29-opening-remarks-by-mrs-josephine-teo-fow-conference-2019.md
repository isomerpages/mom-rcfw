Dato Lim Jock Hoi, Secretary-General of  ASEAN,

Fellow Ministers and senior officials from ASEAN and partner nations,

My co-hosts this morning

Sister Mary Liew, President of  NTUC

Brothers and sisters from the Singapore tripartite movement,

Distinguished Delegates,

Ladies and Gentlemen,

**Introduction**

1.  Good morning. On behalf of the tripartite partners in Singapore, welcome to the Conference on the Future of Work, especially to all our overseas delegates.
2.  The Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) are honoured to co-organise this conference together with the International Labour Organization (ILO).
3.  The topic today is the Future of Work. All of us have a vested interest in it.
    -   Unionists are concerned about workers’ livelihoods,
    -   Businesses wonder how their workforce must adapt,
    -   Governments want to make sure that growth is inclusive, economies stay vibrant, and societies remain cohesive.
4.  We congratulate the ILO on its centenary and thank DG Guy Ryder for ILO’s leadership in starting important conversations about the future of work.
    -   The Global Commission’s report is aptly titled “Work for a Brighter Future”.
    -   It made clear each country should develop its own set of national strategies, adapted to national circumstances.
    -   But learning from each other is always helpful.
5.  Our conference in Singapore hopes to make a small contribution to this important global conversation

**ASEAN**

6.  The great advantage for ASEAN is that our economies are growing. If this were not so, it will be harder to look to the future with a sense of hope.
    -   With more than 640 million people, ASEAN is today collectively the world’s fifth-largest economy.
    -   ASEAN’s economy has grown by an average of 5.3% annually since 2000, above the global average of 3.8%.
    -   Our GDP has more than quadrupled over the last two decades to about US$2.7 trillion1  today. This is faster than many other emerging economies.
8.  Even with an overall growth story, we are not without challenges.
