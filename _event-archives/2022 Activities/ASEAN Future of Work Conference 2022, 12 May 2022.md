The theme of this year's Conference was "**Navigating Labour Market Recovery: A Balancing Act for Businesses, Workers and Governments**".

The Conference discussed how governments, unions and the private sector can work together to balance stakeholder needs and interests, in adapting to new ways of working and preparing workers for the jobs of the future. 

We were honoured to have an extinguished list of speakers from the International Labour Organization (ILO), Singapore, the Philippines and the People's Republic of China, on our four panel discussions: 

1.	The Future of AI in HR: Balancing Innovation, Ethics and Governance
2.	Successful Flexible Work Arrangements: Managing the Trade-offs between Remote and Onsite Work 
3.	Strengthening Labour Protections for Platform Workers: A Delicate Balance Between Protecting Workers and Promoting Enterprise Competitiveness 
4.	Employability or Employment: Supporting Our Youth for the Best Start at Work
