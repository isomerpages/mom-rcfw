Amidst much uncertainty and dampened economic activity, businesses worldwide are still battling the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Coupled with digitalisation and transformation challenges, the journey to recovery is set to be protracted. To promote safe working conditions for all workers and instil a preventive culture that safeguards workers' safety and health, the RCFW partnered the Workplace Safety and Health Council (WSHC) to organise the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health Conference 2020. 

During the Opening Address, Mrs Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower reiterated that "it is now more crucial than ever for everyone to step up in the areas of workplace health, technology and ownership" as we have "witnessed how a public health crisis can cripple businesses and economies". She added that there was a cear concensus amongst the WSH International Advisory Panel that "workplace safety and health will be a big priority in the future of work". 

Over 1,800 participants from Singapore and across the Asia Pacific, including Japan, South Korea, and Australia attended the 2-day virtual conference.
